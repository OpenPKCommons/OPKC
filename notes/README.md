Our first step is gathering a few viral kinetics databases to see what kind of schema might accommodate the data we care most about. 

Here are the ones we'll start with: 

- [**Daily longitudinal sampling of SARS-CoV-2 infection reveals substantial heterogeneity in infectiousness**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01105-z) (Ke *et al.*) [Data link](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41564-022-01105-z/MediaObjects/41564_2022_1105_MOESM4_ESM.xlsx)
- **Viral kinetics of sequential SARS-CoV-2 infections** (Kissler *et al.*)
- **Combined analyses of within-host SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics and information on past exposures to the virus in a human cohort identifies intrinsic differences of Omicron and Delta variants** (Russell *et al.*)
- **Kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 Shedding in Nursing Home Residents and Staff** (Katz *et al.*)
- **Mucosal and systemic immune correlates of viral control after SARS-CoV-2 infection challenge in seronegative adults** (Wagstaffe *et al.*)
